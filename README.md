           Ascii-Art-Web

This is my first Web project written in go. It's a web server for outputting the text in a graphic representation of ASCII and dowloading a file with it.
execute: go run main.go

Ascii-art-web consists in creating and running a server, in which it will be possible to use a web GUI (graphical user interface) version of a program that outputs text in a graphical representation of ASCII (ascii-art project in my ascii-art repo)

Basic requirements:

    You must use your ascii-art application for this project.
    You can run your server locally (localhost) or using an API.
    You must use the different banners for the website.
    It should be available to choose between the banners.
    You have to use the right HTTP methods.
    You need to have a well established connection between server and client.

This project will help you learn about :

    Client utilities.
    Back-end and front-end.
    The basics of web :
        Server
        HTML
        HTTP
        HTTP methods
        HTTP status
    Ways to receive data
    Ways to output data

Instructions

    You must handle website errors(400, 404 and 500).
    The web server must be created in Go.
    The code must respect the good practices.
    The project must have files written in HTML.
